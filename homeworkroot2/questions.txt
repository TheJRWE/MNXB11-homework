1: struct has public members by default while class has private members.
Hence with struct the members such as variables and functions are accesible from outside the struct.

2: Changed the name to HWroot2 since it is the 2nd root homework.

3: Since we are working in root. Many classes in root comes from TObject and thus sharing the same base components.

4: It is compiling without errors.

5-7: Should be working as intended I believe?

8: Kind of works.

9: Can't seem to make it work. Gave up.
